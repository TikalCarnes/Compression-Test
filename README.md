Program Written and Updated by Tikal Carnes
This is a free program for mechanics to try out and see if it is something they can use.
I wrote this program so I could keep track of all vehicles that I do a compression test on.

How to use:
Download zip file and unzip to any directory.
Run the setup program
Enjoy.
